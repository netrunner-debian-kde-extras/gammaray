GammaRay uses the CMake buildsystem.
You must have CMake version 2.8 or higher.

Please see the comments at the top of CMakeLists.txt for
the available configuration options you can pass to cmake.

The installation directory defaults to /usr/local on UNIX
c:/Program Files on Windows and /Applications on MacOS.
You can change this location by passing the option
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path to cmake.

To build a debug version pass -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug to cmake.

To build GammaRay you will need:
 - CMake 2.8
 - Qt 4.7 or higher

Building on Unix with gcc or clang:
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake ..
% make
% make install

Building on Windows with Microsoft Visual Studio:
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
% nmake
% nmake install


Building on Windows with mingw:
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
% mingw32-make
% mingw32-make install

== Warning! ==
If your Qt is linked with the "-Bsymbolic-function" option preloading will be
broken.  When this is enabled, references to global functions will be bound to
the shared object internally; therefore, the definition of the function will be
fixed and cannot be overwritten by preloading.

So, be sure that your distro-provided packages or your self-compiled packages
are not linked with this flag (check with `echo $LDFLAGS` before compiling).
For more info see: "man ld; search for "-Bsymbolic-function".

Known affected distros:

    Ubuntu 10.10, 11.04

If you are affected by this, try the gdb injector instead by using the "-i gdb"
command line argument.
