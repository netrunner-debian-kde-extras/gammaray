GammaRay uses the CMake buildsystem.

Please see the comments at the top of CMakeLists.txt for
the available configuration options you can pass to cmake.

The installation directory defaults to /usr/local on UNIX
c:/Program Files on Windows and /Applications on MacOS.
You can change this location by passing the option
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path to cmake.

To build a debug version pass -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug to cmake.

To build GammaRay you will need:
 - CMake 2.8.9 (or 2.8.11 on Windows)
 - Qt 4.7 or higher

Optional FOSS packages (eg. VTK, Graphviz, etc) provide extra functionality.
See the "Optional Dependencies" section below for more details.

Building on Unix with gcc or clang:
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake ..
% make
% make install

Building on Windows with Microsoft Visual Studio:
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
% nmake
% nmake install

Building on Windows with mingw:
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
% mingw32-make
% mingw32-make install

== Building with Private Qt Headers ==
To build against private Qt headers (necessary for painter debugging/profiling)
you must have a build version of Qt available. Make sure the qmake found first
in your execute comes from this build version.

For example, if your Qt build is in /data/Qt/4.8 then:
 % export PATH=/data/Qt/4.8/bin:$PATH # on Linux using bash


== Optional Dependencies ==
GammaRay relies on optional (FOSS) dependencies to help provide some of its
functionality.  For example, you'll need VTK (http://www.vtk.org) to build
the object visualizer and Graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org) for the state
machine visualizer.

When you run cmake it will inform you about these missing dependencies.

You can also force CMake to ignore any or all of the optional dependencies
by passing the option -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PACKAGE>=True.
For instance:
# tell cmake to ignore Graphiz and VTK
cmake -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_GRAPHVIZ=True -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_VTK=True


== Warning! ==
If your Qt is linked with the "-Bsymbolic-function" option preloading will be
broken.  When this is enabled, references to global functions will be bound to
the shared object internally; therefore, the definition of the function will be
fixed and cannot be overwritten by preloading.

So, be sure that your distro-provided packages or your self-compiled packages
are not linked with this flag (check with `echo $LDFLAGS` before compiling).
For more info see: "man ld; search for "-Bsymbolic-function".

Known affected distros:

    Ubuntu 10.10, 11.04

If you are affected by this, try the gdb injector instead by using the "-i gdb"
command line argument.
